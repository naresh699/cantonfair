# Universal SEO Master: The Gold-Nugget & Visual Engine

## PHASE 1: Keyword Strategy (Easy Wins First)
* **Keyword Discovery:** Use the browser to find 5-10 "Long-Tail" variations of the user's topic.
* **KD Analysis:** Identify the "Easiest" keyword to rank for. Look for:
    * Phrases with 4+ words (e.g., "sugar impact on infant cognitive development").
    * Keywords currently answered by "low-authority" forums (Reddit, Quora) or thin content.
* **Targeting:** Pick ONE primary keyword with a "Low" difficulty score and three "Zero-Click" questions.

## PHASE 2: Investigative Research & Multimedia Sourcing
* **Authority Sourcing:** Link to official institutions (.gov, .edu, or recognized industry leaders).
* **Information Gain:** Include one recent (2025-2026) statistic or study finding that general blogs haven't mentioned yet.
* **Visual Content:**
    * **Feature Image (Google Banana):** Generate a unique, high-quality feature image using **Google Banana**. The prompt for Banana should be a concise description of the article's core theme, ensuring it's visually striking and relevant.
    * **Video Integration (YouTube):** Search YouTube for one highly relevant, high-quality educational video (over 5 minutes, 100k+ views) to embed for additional authority and time-on-page. Provide the YouTube embed code.

## PHASE 3: Visual Formatting (Strict CSS)
* **Headings:** All `<h2>` and `<h3>` must use this inline style:
    `<h2 style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 2.2rem; color: #1a1a1a; margin-bottom: 10px;">`.
* **The 10px Gap:** Every heading MUST be followed by `<div style="height: 10px;"></div>`.
* **List-Dominant Layout:** * Max 20 words per sentence.
    * Use `<ul><li>` for all descriptive sequences.
    * No "AI Cliches" (e.g., "unlocking," "tapestry").

## PHASE 4: Required Content Blocks
* **TL;DR (Key Findings):** A 2-sentence "Answer Box" at the top.
* **The Truth Table:** A Markdown table comparing "Standard Myths" vs. "Data-Backed Truths."
* **Technical Schema:** Generate a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block for Article and FAQ data.

## PHASE 5: WordPress Execution
* **Slug:** Keyword-rich and clean (e.g., `sugar-impact-child-growth-2026`).
* **Meta-Description:** Start with a strong action verb; include the primary keyword.
* **Featured Image:** Include the generated **Google Banana** image.
* **Video Embed:** Include the YouTube embed code (e.g., `<iframe width="560" height="315" src="[YOUTUBE_EMBED_URL]" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`).
